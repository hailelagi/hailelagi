## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've previously mostly worked on the backend of fintech startups for about two years.
Iâ€™m currently reading: Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces 
I'm trying? to make a storage engine in rust, [based on some weird and wacky ideas](https://github.com/hailelagi/lettuce).
I've been at this for awhile :) sorry it's taking so long, but i hope to release it soon.
I'm very much looking for new opportunities!
